                    45km long-range battery
                    Take the journey further
                    With the highly safe 18650 power lithium battery, 474Wh capacity, large power supply and efficient acceleration, the
                    scooter can take you up to 45km on a single charge. The smart power management system offers six different protective
                    measures, and you can easily check the health of the battery via the mobile app.

                <p>
                    In order to extend battery life, the scooter converts and stores kinetic energy during acceleration into
                    electrical power. It's also fitted with a regenerative braking system for addition power. This enhances the
                    emergency braking system and improves the battery life at the same time.
